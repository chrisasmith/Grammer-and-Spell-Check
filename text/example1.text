Last week I had the good fortune to travel with my family to Southern Alberta. I had travelled there once before about fifteen years ago, but this was the first time I had been there with my children. The province of Alberta is significantly different from British Columbia, and there is a lot to see. Its geography is unlike BC’s, and, because of this difference, Alberta has something we seldom find here- dinosaur fossils. The good things about travelling within Canada are that you don’t need extra identification such as a passport, the people and services are familiar, and best of all, you can use Canadian money. All these benefits made the trip uncomplicated. While we were there, we went to three interesting places: The Royal Tyrell  Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Dinosaur Provincial Park near Brooks and the premiere “Star Trek” museum in Canada, Trekcetera, in Vulcan.
